In this technical report, we have proposed two video streaming project based on NDN, which are NDNLive and NDNTube. They all follow the ADU design pattern by chopping the stream into video or audio frames but not the fixed-size segmentation, which will not preserve the Application Data Units' boundaries. This provides the flexibility and also efficiency to the application. We introduce the architecture, name space and implementation details of them respectively. We consider they are the first and complete implementation by using a new NDN Interests-Data exchanging library called Consumer / Producer API. NDNLive and NDNTube have shown some basic usages of that API and can also be treated as a good tutorial of how to use Consumer / Producer API.
