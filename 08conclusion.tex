This technical report provides a detailed view on two video streaming applications: NDNlive and NDNtube.
NDNlive is capable of streaming live video captured with the camera, and NDNtube is capable of streaming video from the mp4 encoded video files. Both applications organize video and audio streams as sequences of frames, which results in a big amount of flexibility in decision making process at the consumer side of the application. Due to the increased flexibility, NDNlive consumer is able to drop the frames which have not been reassembled by the playback deadline in order to keep up with the live stream. 

NDNlive and NDNtube have different requirements for the user experience and, therefore, use different data retrieval protocols --- UDR/RDR and RDR, respectively. Both applications serve as good and relatively complete examples of using Consumer / Producer API for people who are interested in developing applications with the current implementation of the library, as well as Consumer / Producer model in general.
